Redondo Village Apartments is a student housing complex located on the southeastern edge of the University of New Mexico campus in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Located at the west-end of the southernmost courtyard is a multi-use building known as a “hut.” Students use the hut as a group study space, a place to organize and host events, and as a lounge.

The objective was to build upon this existing structure, increasing capacity and adding functional space. Within a footprint boundary of 32’ x 52’ x 52’, multiple levels were added, forming a 4-story tower. The space accommodates a wide range of activities, including recreation, administration, and study. The building is designed with the adjacent lawn in mind in order to establish a free-flowing relationship between the two.
