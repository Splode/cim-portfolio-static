The Neuendorf House by John Pawson is a holiday house for a German art dealer located in Mallorca, Spain. Set in an almond grove with views to the sea and a backdrop of mountains, it is a cubic volume featuring a courtyard with massive walls dyed red with local soil and an infinity-pool which rolls out from the interior. The project consists of descriptive illustrations as well as panels which argue that the conceptual foundation of the house is that the house serves as a nexus for the elements, gathering water and sky at a central earth point.
