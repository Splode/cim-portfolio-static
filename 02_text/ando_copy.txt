Kidosaki House, designed by Tadao Ando, is a three-family residence in Tokyo, Japan. Built for a couple and their respective parents, the house offers a blend of privacy and shared space for three families within a single home. This project centered around a series of diagrams compiled into graphical presentations which explored the logic behind the house's many organizational points.
