The Buddhist Mandala ceremony is a long-standing tradition wherein monks create a mandala using colored sand. In 2011, a group of visiting monks performed this ceremony at UNM's Hibben Center. Over the span of a few days, the monks worked mindfully to create the tableau and when it was completed, swept the mandala up into piles of sand and to be spread into the waters of the Rio Grande. The mandala represents the universe and the ritual itself illustrates the impermanence of being.
