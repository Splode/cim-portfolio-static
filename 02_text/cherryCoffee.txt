A handcrafted coffee table made from American cherry hardwood.
=== Project Description ===
Simply, it is a handcrafted and designed coffee table. It features a lower shelf for device remote controls, coffee table books, etc. Goals for this project were to create a piece of furniture that was both sculptural and functional, bold yet simple.
The design features several interesting construction points, such as: chamfered edges on the top, side, and bottom panels, mitered joints with perpendicular splines, a lower shelf that is double-blind mortised into the side panel, and two floating tenons connecting the lower shelf into the crosspiece.
