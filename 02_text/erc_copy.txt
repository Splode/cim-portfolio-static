The trouble with emergencies is that they strike devastatingly and without warning. To counter the unexpected, we rely upon established systems and professionals who are dedicated to being prepared and ever-vigilant. Emergency professionals must be flexible, courageous, and focussed in the face of adversity. The design approach for the Albuquerque Readiness Center should therefore evoke a sense of vigilance, alacrity, and stalwartness, while providing practical support for the professionals and the equipment they rely upon. It should embody the strength and vitality that is required of emergency professionals. Because the men and women who respond to emergencies and work in disaster areas are subjected to harrowing and challenging circumstances, the Albuquerque Readiness Center also serves as a place of respite and recuperation.
